# TypeScript Service Repository Pattern with IoC

This TypeScript project demonstrates the implementation of the Service Repository Pattern in conjunction with Inversion of Control (IoC) for building maintainable and modular applications.

## Overview

- **Service Repository Pattern**: The project adheres to the Service Repository Pattern, which separates concerns between data access (repository) and business logic (service). It ensures that your application's data access is clean and consistent, promoting maintainability.

- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: We use IoC containers, such as InversifyJS, to manage dependencies and facilitate the injection of services into controllers and other components. This promotes decoupling and flexibility in managing dependencies.

## Features

- **Service Abstraction**: Business logic is encapsulated within services, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Data Access Abstraction**: Repositories provide an abstraction layer for data access, allowing you to switch data sources without affecting the business logic.

- **IoC Container**: IoC containers help manage dependencies and facilitate dependency injection.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your system.

2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

3. **Configuration**: Configure your IoC container to handle dependencies. Update the configuration as needed.

4. **Usage**: Implement your business logic within services and interact with repositories for data access.

5. **Testing**: Utilize unit tests to verify the functionality of services and repositories.

## Examples
